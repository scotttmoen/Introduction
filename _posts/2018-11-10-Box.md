This laser cut file is for creating a tabbed box. The tabs are integrated to help align the panels for assembly. There is no hinge in the design intentionally; this allows for multiple methods for securing the box such as gaskets, magnets, and compression fittings. Adjust tab size when changing material thickness and box dimensions.
