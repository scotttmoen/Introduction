I wanted an off-line voice-controlled light and alarm. The EasyVR system works great as a rudimentary system for voice control, without needing network access. Alexa this ain't...but it also is not collecting any personal information. For the alarm trigger, I used a PIR sensor which was adjusted for its environment. I housed all the electronics (e.g. easyVR, arduino, microphone, speaker, high-power LED, and PIR) in a one box.
