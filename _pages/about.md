I'm the Director of Health Innovation at the University of Texas, Medical Branch. My job is to design and create viable products, along with their associated promotional materials, for ideas introduced by the faculty. This has involved microfluidic diagnostics, electronics and microprocessors, 3D printing and code. I primarily develop Swift iOS and web apps, but have been moving towards machine learning.
